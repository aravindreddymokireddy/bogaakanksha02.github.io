                    glass technology and led a young team to initiate this effort in ISRO from design, development
                    leading to production of composites rocket motor cases. Dr. Kalam made significant contribution
                    as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3) which
                    successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India
                    an exclusive member of Space Club</p>
                <br>
                <p>He was responsible for the evolution of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV
                    configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering launch vehicle technologies,
                    Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided Missiles at Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive of Integrated Guided Missile
                    Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible for the development and operationalisationof
                    AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and for building indigenous capability in critical technologies
                    through networking of multiple institutions. One of his significant contribution was creating

                    Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration with Department of Atomic Energy, which made India a
                    nuclear weapon State. He also gave thrust to self-reliance in defence systems by progressing
                    multiple development tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.</p>
